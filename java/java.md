# Java Resources
Java is the main robot programming language the software team uses. 
You may choose between the codecademy course or the citrus circuits training slides when learning java. 

## CodeCademy
Free ~12 hour course https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java
This course is officially recommended by WPIlib
If you choose this route it is recommended to break this up into bite sized pieces
Takes longer, but is more professional with teaching and assessments than the training slides
Recommended for people with little-no java experience already.

### Citrus Circuits Java Training Slides
These slideshows are the main java training curriculum for software
We recommend doing all assignments before moving on to the next section, as they will help prepare for the tests. 
You must pass each test with a score above 80% in order to move on to the next section.
