### WPIlib training
This document will provide resources for understanding how to perform basic operations of wpilib including creating a robot project, the fundamentals of command based programming, spinning motors, creating a drivebase, and running code on the robot
We will only cover basic operations because there are countless useful wpilib objects and you will have to do research through the docs to find the  ones you need to use to accomplish your robot programming goals. 
I recommend following these resources in order
Tests are required and will follow the same requirement from the last chapter of 80% unless otherwise noted. 

## Command Based Programming
The specific programming paradigm we use to organize our robot projects.

1. [What is Command Based Programming](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/commandbased/what-is-command-based.html)
2. [Commands]9https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/commandbased/commands.html)
3. [Subsystems](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/commandbased/subsystems.html)
4. Test What are commands and subsystems - PlaceHolder
5. [Structuring a Command Based Project](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/commandbased/structuring-command-based-project.html)
6. [Organizing a Command Based Project](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/commandbased/organizing-command-based.html)
