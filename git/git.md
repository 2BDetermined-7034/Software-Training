# Git Training
Git is the tool we use to manage different versions of our robot projects across multiple computers. It has many powerful and convenient features for managing branching versions of our code.
I recommend being extra dilligent when following this chapter as you will be using this tool every day in robotics, and likely for any other software project outside of robotics. 
It is extremely powerful but also sensitive to frustrating errors and screwups.

> [!NOTE]  
> Git and Github are not the same thing. Git is the name of the version control system, and runs locally on your local cloned copy of a repository. Github, on the other hand, is a free cloud storage service owned by Microsoft for hosting git repositories, which allows collaboration with other machines.
