# Git Training
Git is the tool we use to manage different versions of our robot projects across multiple computers, and allows us to make branches and backups of our projects at our convenience.
I recommend being extra dilligent when following this chapter as you will be using this tool every day in robotics, and likely for any other software project outside of robotics. 
It is extremely powerful but also sensitive to frustrating errors and screwups.
The test on this subject will be more difficult than the others.
