# FRC Driverstation
Frc driverstation is the application which sends packets between the laptop and the robot. It is responsible for enabling/disabling, 
triggering autonomous/practice conditions, handling controller inputs; and logging important debug information like battery voltage, CAN utilization, radio uptime, etc. 

Use this for everything, it will be a short one.

### Best Shortcuts
F1 - Force a Joystick refresh.

[ + ] + \ - Enable the robot (the 3 keys above Enter on most keyboards)

Enter - Disable the Robot
