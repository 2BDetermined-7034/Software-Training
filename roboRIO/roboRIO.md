# roboRIO
This section is about working with the roboRIO, from imaging the firmware, setting the team number, and debugging issues via ssh.

> [!NOTE]
> The roboRIO 1 and roboRIO 2 are distinctly different and have their own procedures
> The Rio 1 is flashed via USB-B, while the Rio 2 is flashed via microUSB
